🧠 Networking Labs by Krishna
 
 This repository contains my practical networking exercises built using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Each lab focuses on key networking concepts — from basic device configuration to advanced routing, VLANs, ACLs, and WAN setups.

Topics Covered:

IP addressing and subnetting

Router and switch configuration

VLANs and trunking

Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)

DHCP, NAT, ACL

WAN and serial connections

Network troubleshooting

💡 Goal: Strengthen my practical networking knowledge and prepare for real-world SOC and network infrastructure roles.
